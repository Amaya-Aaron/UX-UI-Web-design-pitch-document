##   UX-UI-Web-design-pitch-document
Web design pitch document 
Choose a bar/restaurant and create a redesigned wireframe for their web site and a prototype page of the home screen. 

You must create a mid-fidelity prototype version of the redesign â€“ meaning you should create a version with an updated colour palette, layout and branding for the site. 

 

## You must include: 

Report (2 pages max) detailing the changes made to the web design versus the original page. 

 

Mock-up design for home screen with new colours, layout, branding. This should be representative of the final site design, as if you are pitching a new design to the bar/restaurant. 
 

Finished wireframe screens with redesigned web app structure, each element labelled clearly and colours used to  
highlight relevant areas. 
You should include 4 redesigned web pages minimum: 

 - Home 
 
- Bookings 
 
- Menu 
 
- Contact 
 

## Information: 
This is an individual project.

In this assignment you must create a redesigned web page concept as a pitch document, detailing the new layout and screens as wireframes along with a final proof-of-concept mock-up of the home screen with final colours, typography choices and branding in place. 

The project does not need to be interactive at this stage.
